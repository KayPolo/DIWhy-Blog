			<p class="content" style="font-weight: bold;">How has the history of a culture be told through obsolete technologies and objects?</p>
			<p class="content">I am exploring how some cultures attribute meaning into material objects, building its own history; and how new generations decode each story embedded on the artifacts, preserving and redefining the historical memory.</p>

			<div class="titles">Do abstract objects tell stories?</div> 
			<p class="content" style="font-weight: bold;">Exploration Process (1st iteration)</p>
			<p class="content">The first user testing was designed to explore how diverse people attribute specific meaning to abstract articles. The initial form of the test consisted of five cases containing materials with different colors and textures. I told the users that those were their memories, they had to organize them and share with me the meaning of each one. I expected to find specific patterns based on similar age or ethnicity. The result was other. Each person linked the objects with very personal aspects of their life. For one user the five object signified different moments during the year. For a second one, the abstract forms represented the important things in life. A third user related the shapes with her childhood. A standard behavior founded in all users was the way that they shared the meaning of the objects. They interconnected the elements, recalling personal stories.

			<p class="content" style="font-weight: bold;">Exploration Process (2nd iteration)</p>
			<p class="content">After a few users test, I modified the experiment, adding more objects. This time, with ten abstract shapes, the user had to pick five out of the total, share the meaning, and explain why those five and not the others. The result of this test wasn't very different. In the second versing, the stories were more elaborated and personal, but I didn't learn anything new. I was looking for some hidden truth in the way we attribute meaning to objects.

	<div id="exploration3" class="exploration3 page">
		<div class="exploration3-container">	
			<p class="content" style="font-weight: bold;">Exploration Process (3rd & 4th iterations)</p>
			<p class="content">I considered conducting a similar test with non abstract items. This time I used small toys. I asked each user to imagine that these toys were the only items they kept from their childhood; they had to explain why they decided to keep them. In some cases, the stories were highly emotional. Some people started to remember moments that weren't necessarily connected to the toys, but somehow the toys triggered of the memories.<br><br>
			For the next variation of the test, I used the tarot cards. The question was simple; which card predicted something positive and which one something negative. The users didn't know the tarot, and the names on the cards were removed. The selection was based mainly on the images. Something peculiar on the tarot cards is that most of the cards that seem to be negative have positive meanings. This test proves that the phrase "A picture is worth a thousand words" is not necessarily truth. When an image is out of context, the meaning can change. The cultural background of the viewer analyzing the cards influences the decision of what is good or bad.  

			</p>
			<img class="fullimg" src="images/exploration3.jpg">	

			<p class="content">After a couple of weeks conducting this experiments.What did I learned? <br>
			• The cultural background of the users affect but not determine the meaning attributed to objects. <br>
			• Even abstract objects can carry concrete meaning.<br>
			• Most of the testers give personal meaning to objects.<br>
			• Different users give unique interpretation to the same objects. <br>
			• Decontextualizing images imply changing their meanings. <br>
			The process was fun, and I feel amazed to have different people openly sharing their personal stories with me, but I didn't have the moment of illumination that I was waiting for. Learning through making helped me to understand how broad was my research question. I had to narrow the possibilities.<br><br>

			<p class="content">Radio Amateurism is a hobby mostly practiced by retired people. With the creation of Facebook and other social media platforms, the practice became less crowded over the years. There are ham radio operators all over the world that feel an infinite pleasure in using radio waves to communicate. The surprising truth about this practice consists in the fact that radio waves are more reliable than fiber optic and cell phone antennas.<br><br>
 			For this prototype, I built a cage that resembles a radio. When the user tries to change the station, s/he hears stories describing how ham radio operators established the communication between the US and Puerto Rico during the Hurricane Maria.
